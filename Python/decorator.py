"""
Defination :

Python has an interesting feature called decorators since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class.
Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it

This is also called metaprogramming because a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time.
